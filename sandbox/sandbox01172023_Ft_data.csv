"L1, L2 = maximum length of Crystal (including tips, in two orientations)"
"W1, W2 = mutually perpendicular widths of orthorhombic prism or equatorial diameters"
"h1, h2 = tip heights of pyramidal terminations (zircons only)"
AI = abrasion index:
"apatite: 1 = both tips present, 1.5 = one tip missing, 2 = both tips missing, DUR = durango"
