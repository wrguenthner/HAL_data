    "# He_line_calc: a notebook for reducing He line data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reduces data produced by a Pfieffer PrismaPlus220 in the Helium Analysis Laboratory (HAL) at the University of Illinois. The HAL uses h6t and Pychron software for data reporting and measures masses 1-5 on line blanks, hot blanks, line gas standards, and samples. We use an isotope dilution approach with a $^3$He spike and a $^4$He reference gas of a known volume. As such, 4/3 gas ratios are measured with corrections for H, D, and HD. This notebook reads in the raw data files from either h6t or Pychron and reports out He amounts in terms of pmol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions for the use of this notebook are provided before each cell of code and should be followed step-by-step. Only one notebook is needed for a complete set of analyses that may encompass multiple days (referred throughout in this notebook as a \"session\"). Some cells will be run at the very beginning of data collection, whereas other cells will be run repeatedly as new data is collected. __Pay attention as to which cells need to be run once, and which will be repeatedly run throughout the data collection process!__ If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, the \"run\" button is found at the top of the notebook, and each cell can be run by highlighting it with the mouse and then clicking the \"run\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "First, save a copy of this notebook to the relevant file on the HAL desktop (C:\\Users\\lab-admin\\Desktop\\Line_summary_sheets\\20XX\\XXX20XX\\'lastname' where the Xs are specific to the date and 'lastname' is the user's last name) and make sure that all data files for a given session are saved to the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first cell imports some useful packages, sets some constants, and intializes several key running means that will be used throughout the notebook. __This cell should be run only once! If it is rerun by accident before you have finished a sample run, you will need to fill in the various lists, sample times, and data frame with the appropriate ones from the cell below.__"
