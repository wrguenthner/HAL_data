    "# (U-Th)/He data reduction notebook for the HAL at UIUC\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was written by William Guenthner in fall of 2022 for the reduction of grain size data, U, Th, Sm, and He measurements towards calculation of (U-Th)/He dates. Some of the inputs and file formats are specific to data generated in the Helium Analysis Laboratory (HAL) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), but hopefully it has broader applicability and utilty for other lab groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is structured to interact with 3 separate CSV files that should be colocated with each instance of the notebook in the same folder. The CSV files are related to: 1) U, Th, Sm, Zr, and Ca amount measurements obtained from ICP-MS anlaysis (obtained with an iCAP Q using Qtegra software at UIUC), 2) He amount measurements (obtained with a PrismaPlus 220 and reported as peak hops on masses 1-5 at UIUC), and 3) grain size measurements for Ft correction. Cells are grouped below roughly in that order of reduction (wet chemistry first, then He, then grain size)."
